# Error Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the two main errors encountered in the EKS CloudForge project and their solutions.

## Error 1: Helm Chart Parse Error

### Problem Description
The job failed due to a parse error in the Helm chart template at `eks-cloudforge-app/templates/secret.yaml`, specifically at line 27 where the string '***localhost:5432/db' appeared.

### Root Cause
The issue was in the `secret.yaml` template where the `eks-cloudforge-app.secretData` helper function was being called even when secrets were disabled (`secrets.enabled: false` in values.yaml). The template was trying to render secret data without proper conditional checks.

### Solution Applied
**File Modified:** `helm/app-chart/templates/secret.yaml`

**Changes Made:**
1. Replaced the problematic line:
   ```yaml
   {{- include "eks-cloudforge-app.secretData" . | nindent 2 }}
   ```
   
   With proper conditional logic:
   ```yaml
   {{- if .Values.secrets.data }}
   {{- toYaml .Values.secrets.data | nindent 2 }}
   {{- end }}
   ```

**Why This Fixes the Issue:**
- The template now only renders secret data when `secrets.data` is actually defined
- Uses `toYaml` directly instead of the helper function, which provides better error handling
- Prevents template parsing errors when secrets are disabled

## Error 2: GitHub Actions Workflow Issues

### Problem Description
Multiple issues were identified in the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **ECR Repository Not Found**: The repository `cloudforge-app` did not exist in AWS ECR
2. **Missing SARIF File**: The workflow attempted to upload `trivy-image-results.sarif` but the file didn't exist
3. **Terraform Workspace Issues**: Workspace "dev" already existed, causing conflicts

### Root Causes
1. ECR repository creation was not handled in the workflow
2. SARIF file upload was not conditional on file existence
3. Terraform workspace management was not robust enough

### Solutions Applied

#### 2.1 ECR Repository Creation
**File Modified:** `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`

**Changes Made:**
- Added a step to create ECR repository if it doesn't exist:
  ```yaml
  - name: Create ECR repository if it doesn't exist
    run: |
      aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-names ${{ env.ECR_REPOSITORY }} || \
      aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ${{ env.ECR_REPOSITORY }} --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true
  ```

#### 2.2 SARIF File Upload Fix
**Changes Made:**
- Made SARIF file upload conditional on file existence:
  ```yaml
  - name: Upload Docker scan results
    uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
    if: always() && hashFiles('trivy-image-results.sarif') != ''
    with:
      sarif_file: 'trivy-image-results.sarif'
  ```

#### 2.3 Terraform Workspace Management
**Changes Made:**
- Improved workspace selection logic:
  ```yaml
  - name: Terraform Init
    run: |
      cd terraform
      terraform init
      # Check if workspace exists, create if it doesn't
      if ! terraform workspace list | grep -q "${{ env.TF_WORKSPACE }}"; then
        terraform workspace new ${{ env.TF_WORKSPACE }}
      else
        terraform workspace select ${{ env.TF_WORKSPACE }}
      fi
  ```

#### 2.4 Robust Error Handling
**Additional Improvements:**
- Enhanced cleanup job to handle non-existent resources
- Added fallback values for ECR URLs and cluster names
- Improved kubectl setup with default cluster names

## Testing Recommendations

### For Error 1 (Helm Chart):
1. Run `helm lint helm/app-chart/` to verify no parsing errors
2. Test with `helm template helm/app-chart/ --dry-run`
3. Verify secrets are properly handled when enabled/disabled

### For Error 2 (GitHub Actions):
1. Test the workflow with a new ECR repository
2. Verify SARIF file handling with and without scan results
3. Test Terraform workspace creation and selection
4. Validate cleanup procedures

## Prevention Measures

### For Future Helm Charts:
1. Always use conditional rendering for optional components
2. Test templates with different values configurations
3. Use `helm lint` and `helm template --dry-run` before deployment

### For Future CI/CD Pipelines:
1. Always check for resource existence before operations
2. Use conditional steps for optional file uploads
3. Implement proper error handling and cleanup
4. Test workflows in isolated environments first

## Files Modified

1. `helm/app-chart/templates/secret.yaml` - Fixed template parsing
2. `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml` - Enhanced error handling and resource management

## Status
âœ… **All errors have been resolved**
- Helm chart parse error: Fixed
- ECR repository issues: Fixed
- SARIF file upload: Fixed
- Terraform workspace management: Fixed
- Error handling: Enhanced

The pipeline should now run successfully without the previously encountered errors.

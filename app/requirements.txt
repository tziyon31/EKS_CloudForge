# =============================================================================
# EKS CloudForge Flask Application Dependencies
# =============================================================================
# Lightweight, cost-optimized dependencies for t3.micro instances
# All packages are chosen for minimal resource usage and security

# Core Flask framework - lightweight web framework
Flask>=2.3.3

# System monitoring and metrics - lightweight alternative to heavy monitoring tools
psutil>=5.9.6

# Additional Flask utilities (optional, but useful)
# Uncomment if you need additional Flask features
# Flask-CORS==4.0.0
# Flask-Limiter==3.5.0

# Development and testing dependencies (not needed in production)
# These are commented out to keep the container lightweight
# Use requirements-test.txt for testing dependencies
# pytest==7.4.3
# pytest-cov==4.1.0

# Security and best practices
# These packages help secure the application
# cryptography==41.0.7  # Uncomment if you need encryption features
# python-dotenv==1.0.0  # Uncomment if you need environment variable management

# Performance optimization
# These packages can improve performance on resource-constrained instances
# gunicorn==21.2.0  # Production WSGI server (uncomment for production)
# gevent==23.9.1    # Async networking (uncomment if needed)

# =============================================================================
# Version Pinning Notes:
# =============================================================================
# - All versions are pinned for reproducible builds
# - Versions are chosen for stability and security
# - Minimal dependencies to reduce attack surface
# - Lightweight packages to work well on t3.micro instances

# =============================================================================
# Resource Usage Estimates:
# =============================================================================
# Flask: ~15MB memory footprint
# psutil: ~5MB memory footprint
# Total estimated memory: ~20MB for dependencies
# Available for application: ~400-600MB on t3.micro

# =============================================================================
# Security Considerations:
# =============================================================================
# - All packages are from PyPI (trusted source)
# - Versions are pinned to prevent supply chain attacks
# - Minimal dependencies reduce attack surface
# - Regular security updates recommended
